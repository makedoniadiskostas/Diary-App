# Diary-App
This project is a personal diary application designed to help users capture and organize their daily experiences in a digital format. The application allows users to create diary entries that include a written description along with an uploaded photo, making it easy to preserve memories in a visual and meaningful way.

Users can add, view, and manage diary entries through a simple and intuitive interface. Each entry stores the date, text content, and an associated image, enabling a richer storytelling experience compared to traditional text-only diaries. The project focuses on usability, clean design, and proper data handling.

From a technical perspective, the application demonstrates core web development concepts such as CRUD operations, file uploads, database integration, and structured project architecture. It also emphasizes good development practices, including input validation and separation of configuration from source code.

This project was built as a practical exercise in building a real-world application that combines user-generated content, media handling, and persistent storage.
